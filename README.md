<h1> UFOs</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
To design a website where visitors can filter UFO sightings using multiple variables including Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. 
<h2>Technology Used</h2>
Utilized JavaScript and Bootstrap to create a dynamic html table. Use the "Clear Filter" button to clear all of the filters. 
<h2>Recommendations for Further Development</h2>
The datasource for this page is static. It would be fascinating to link to a live datasource instead.
